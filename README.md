# Multi-Model Stock Analyst using GPT4v: Automated Decision Systems

This was a project for CS458 Automated Decisions Systems at Yale University. The brief was to create a stock analyst would take a given stock and give a buy, hold or sell recommendation and be able to explain why it did so. I modelled the relationship between 19 financial metrics against their likelihood of indicating a better than SPY performance via a logistic GAM. For any given stock, I plot their metrics on the partial dependence plot of these models and the subsequent image would be fed to GPT4-Vision. I engineered a prompt that would guide GPT in interpreting these plots to see how well the company was doing relative to the market on these metrics then give a coherent rationale for a recommendation. The user also has the option to indicate what type of portfolio they're considering the stock for: income, growth, or ESG. The prompt would nudge the model to consider the metrics most important for those portfolios. For the ESG mode especially, the base model's output would be integrated with the opinion of an "ESG Analyst", which independently assessed the stock based on its ESG scores. This simulates a corporate scenario where there is an equity analyst, an ESG analyst, and a PM.
